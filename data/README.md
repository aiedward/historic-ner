# Data

We used the pre-processed datasets (ONB and LFT) from the
[A Named Entity Recognition Shootout for German](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/papers/P/P18/P18-2020/)
paper. Unfortunately, the datasets are not publicly available. Thus, you have
to contact Martin Riedl to obtain the dataset.

Once you've obtained the datasets, put all files in this folder here. We expect
the following files:
 
* `enp_DE.lft.mr.tok.{train,dev,test}.bio` - LFT dataset
* `enp_DE.onb.mr.tok.{train,dev,test}.bio` - ONB dataset
